Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to diagnose whether someone may have coronavirus, a cold, the flu, or seasonal allergies by basing the code on their response and then supplying them with their results.
 
Known Issues:
A known issue of the goal is that the type of condition the person taking this survey may not even be any of the options because there are many more types of sicknesses. This determination is much more extensive than simply diagnosing the type of headache with 11 questions.
