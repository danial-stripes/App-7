Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to diagnose whether someone has a tension type headache or migrane by basing the code on their responses and then supplying them with their results.
 
Known Issues:
A known issue of the goal is that the type of headache that the person taking the survey has may not even be a tension type headache or migrane because there are many more types of headaches. This determination is much more extensive than simply diagnosing the type of headache with 4 questions.
